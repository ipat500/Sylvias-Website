        <h5>Hi, My name is Sylvia Durrant and I am the bird lady of Rothesay Bay, Auckland.  I have been tending to sick and injured birds for over 30 years.  Thousands of birds, many of them babies, pass through my sanctuary every year. I am open 24 hours a day 7 days a week and trust me it is hard work I have lots of volenteers that help everyday if you would like to become a volenteer (you have to be over 12) you can email me at <a>sylviathebirdlady@gmail.com</a> </h5>
