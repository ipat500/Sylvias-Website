        <h2>Feeding baby birds</h2>
        <h4><b>Basic Recipe:</b></h4>
        <h4>For 1 bird per day. Food to be kept at room temperature, do not keep overnight.</h4>
        <li>1 teaspoon of raw egg yolk (white is <b>not</b> used as it hardens and cause indegestible strings.)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of glucose</li>
        <li>Pinch of Bone-Gro calcium powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of plain blue-colour code baby cereal</li>
        <li>Few drops of vitamin liquid eg: Tech Vet</li>
       <h4>Mix together with water to create a soft custard consistency.</h4>
        <h4>This mixture is fed via an eyedropper and as the birds gradually feather and feed well, other ingredients are added and the mix should be gradually thickened until the bird can be fed from a tooth pick, ice block stick or finger.</h4>
        <h4>Other ingredients are added depending on what is eaten in the natural diet.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Blackbirds, Song Thrushes, Starlings and other insect eaters.</b></h4>
        <h4>Add raw mince or cat food to basic mix. When the bird starts to move about, the baby cereal can be progressively replaced with chicking laying mash. When the bird is almost mature, it will eat ripe fruit.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Silvereyes/Waxeyes and other fruit or nectar feeders</b></h4>
        <h4>Add blue label fruity baby food, banana, pawpaw, kiwi fruit or other seasonal fruit. Until they are fully feathered they will need some mince in their mixture. Cat food may also be used.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Tui</b></h4>
        <h4>Tui need</h4>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ensure powder (from the chemist)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of fruit pulp</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of fruit juice with no sugar or preservatives. (Logies Honey and Apricot nectar are recommended) </li>
        <h4>Mix with water and thicken with a little farex witch can be a fruity kind instead of plain. Small chicks need mince added until they of their own volition start "chuckling" it out of their mouth when it is fed to them. At this stage it is a good idea to put food in a suitable container in easy reach of the bird which will quickly learn to feed by itself.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Welcome Swallows, Fantails, Warblers, and Skylarks</b></h4>
        <h4>As featherless chicks can only have basic mix but seem to be better if they are only given raw mince without presevitives with only Bone-Gro and Vitamin drops added. Best fest with a toothpick. Moisten the meat with a little water as the bird is fed.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Seabirds</b></h4>
        <h4>Add a few drops of codliver oil to basic mix and once feathers appear, give vitamised fish without skin or bones. As appitite increases, change to small slivers dipped in basic mix. </h4>
        <h4><B>***Add a small pinch of salt to food at least every 2 days</B></h4>
        <h4><b>***NOTE: Do not feed young marine birds Kawahai, Mackerel, or Spotties.</b></h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Sparrows, Chaffinches, Greenfinches and Goldfinches</b></h4>
        <h4>Basic mix plus brown bread or conditioning food as bought in pet shops. Aternate throughout the day as these bird like a great variety of foods.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Magpies</b></h4>
        <h4>Basic Mix and mince or cat food. As their feathers grow, give hard boiled egg, strips of meat, meal worms and cat biscuits</h4>
        <h4><b>***Magpies also enjoy small bits of fruit and cheese.</b></h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Moreporks</b></h4>
        <h4>Tiny pieces of dead chicken or mouse, mince meat with with Bone-Gro and multi vitamins added once daily when the chicks are very small. As the feathers replace the down, increase the amount and size of pieces accordingly. As the size of the bird increases, begin to leave large pieces in the cage at night. Feed from 6pm onwards throughout the night. Leave them to  sleep covered in daylight. they need skin, bones and feathers/fur for their crop to function properly. They will regurgitate a pellet of scraps regulary.</h4>
